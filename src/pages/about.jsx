      <h2>Liam's Cheesecake: A Unique Twist to a Traditional Dessert</h2>
      <p>
      Founded in 2018, Liam's Cheesecake's purpose for business is to provide people like you the tastiest 
      cheesecake creations ever to be enjoyed. The company was founded by Liam Danz, an
      entrepreneur with a passion for making people the best desserts. The idea for this 
      unique twist of cheesecake came from seeing posts on Instagram of different desserts in 
      mason jars and Liam's love for cheesecake itself! Who doesnâ€™t love cheesecake?! The future goal of Liam's Cheesecake 
      is to be able to ship our cheesecake right to your door! We at Liam's Cheesecake 
      believe everyone should get to enjoy cheesecake in a non-traditional way.
